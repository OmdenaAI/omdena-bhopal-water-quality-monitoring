You can visit the visualisation Part for Lendiya Lake and observe the Graph, what story does this Data tells you & What are the conclusion.

Ph is between 7.4 to 8.2 => higher pH means Basic Properties in water, Drinkable Water pH is 7 to 8 
Chlorophyll is Normalised => higher values means presence of Algae or any materials with the ability to use Photosynthesis
Tubidity is Normalised => higher values of turbidity means less clarity in water, thus "Not Drinkable"
Dissolved Oxygen (DO) in mg/L & normalised (2 csv) => Higher Values of DO signifies more oxygen in water, which is good for aquatic life & also "Drinkable"
Dissolved Organic Matter(DOM) is Normalised => More DOM means decomposable object are present in the water, good for aquatic life
Temperature in Degree Celcius => Surface temperature of water
Suspended Matter => What are the oganic/inorganic matter present in the water
